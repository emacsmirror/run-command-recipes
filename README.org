   followed code to you config:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package run-command-recipes
         :ensure t :after (run-command)
         :init (run-command-recipes-use-all))
   #+END_SRC

   Or manually:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-run-command-recipes")

   If you need to use all supported language, just put this to your
   code:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (run-command-recipes-use-all)
   #+end_src

   If you need to use only special languages, just put this:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (run-command-recipes-use latex pandoc)
   #+end_src

   Also Instead of =LaTeX= and =pandoc= you can use something from
   this:

- =python= ([[file:docs/python.org][link on support]])
- =pandoc= ([[file:docs/pandoc.org][link on support]])
- =latex= ([[file:docs/latex.org][link on support]])
- =elisp= ([[file:docs/elisp.org][link on support]])
