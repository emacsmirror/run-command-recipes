** Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: commands
:END:

In this recipe I define only 1 type of commands:

- Make: <command>

It means when you call ~run-command~ inside a project which have ~Makefile~ in the root directory, you can select one of the defined inside ~Makefile~ commands and it will be normally executed.

Notice that if GNU Make executable wasn't found it won't working

** Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: customization
:END:

Here only two option to customize.  The first is ~run-command-recipes-make-executable~ which specify the path of GNU Make executable, it defaults to "make".  The second is ~run-command-recipes-makefile-names~ which specify the names which ~Makefile~ can have.
