* ~run-command~'s Recipe for C

** Commands
Here the list of the commands of the ~C~ recipe (4 commands, by my count):

- Compile and Execute Current file via ~gcc~
- Compile Only Current file via ~gcc~
- Compile and Execute Current file via ~clang~
- Compile Only Current file via ~clang~
** Choose between GCC and Clang

Begin copy paste part

NOTE: that I provide two different recipes functions (for clang and GCC) which are almost the same, but both of them are useful for C.

The more naive way is to write one function for clang and GCC, but in this case user can't delete avoid usage one of them.  Now you can do anything like:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(advice-add 'run-command-recipes-c-gcc :around #'ignore)
#+END_SRC

and disable GCC support

(you can also with this way disable Clang)
