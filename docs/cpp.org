** Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: customization
:END:

You can customize detection of ~c++~ buffer in which this recipe should work, for it just change the variable ~run-command-recipes-cpp-modes~.  If you need to special way of detection buffers try redefine function =run-command-recipes-cpp-p= which return ~non-nil~ when this recipe should work now

*** Flags for Compiler

If you aren't happy with the default flags passed to compiler, you can change them.

For it see the variable ~run-command-recipes-cpp-flags~
