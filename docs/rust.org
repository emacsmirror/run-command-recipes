    :CUSTOM_ID: detect-rust-file

For detect rust file, =run-command-recipes= has variable
=run-command-recipes-rust-modes=, which contains modes on which this
recipes will work, defaults to: * =rust-mode= * =rustic-mode=

Also has variable =run-command-recipes-rust-mode-p-funtion= which

*** Compile Command
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: compile-command
    :END:
=rust-command-recipes-rust-rustc-compile-command= is string, which is

=rust-command-recipes-rust-rustc-run-command= is string, which is shell
