# emacs-run-command-recipes

This is collection of recipes to [run-command](https://github.com/bard/emacs-run-command "cool package!").

Usage
-------
If you need to use all supported language, just put this to your code:
```emacs-lisp
(run-command-recipes-use-all)
```

If you need to use only special languages, just put this:
```emacs-lisp
(run-command-recipes-use latex
                         pandoc)
```

Also Instead of `LaTeX` and `pandoc` you can use something from this:

* `latex` ([link on support](docs/latex.md "hi"))
* `pandoc`([link on support](docs/pandoc.md "hi"))
